# mingo
This is a Python implementation of the Music Bingo bar game, aka MINGO. It is command-line oriented. It requires a subscription to the
Spotify music service. A Spotify application that is configured using the Spotify Developer API web page is necessary.
Access to the Spotify API is done using the Spotipy library that wraps the actual Spotify APIs.
